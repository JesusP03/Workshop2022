Reto

In this challenge we needed to create instances from OpenStack using Flask, creating our API and later deploy it in a Fron-End app, in this case a HTLM file, where the user can choose the name, the image, the flavor, the networks, keys, and security groups

For run this project you need:

Boostrap 5. (CSS)
flask (Python)
requests (Python)
